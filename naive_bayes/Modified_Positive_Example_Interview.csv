5,I got into a fight with my best friend and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before really hard it's um he's my best friend and i miss him but we messed up and it's just it's not the same it's like not the same friendship me too
1,i'm okay
4,that is a hard question i think in november after i got out of the hospital i finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown chicago and we went to the sears tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool
6,not that easy at all um just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hard have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing um i guess just sometimes they reflect things that i'm worried about or happening in my life but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen and it's usually no you dreamed that sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up probably like two nights ago
30,I forgot to water my roomates plants last weekend
