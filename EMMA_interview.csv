30,I feel guilty about not visiting or calling my grandmother is more often
6,most of the time it's really easy for me to get a good night's sleep sometimes it's a bit harder but when it's harder for me I normally put on a meditation video or audio and then I end up falling asleep pretty quickly
5,I can't even remember it so well I think the last time I argued with someone was with an airline representative after my flight was canceled and they didn't want to reimburse it
4,the last time I felt really happy was yesterday night I had a wine tasting with my friends and we were having fun laughing a lot
1,I'm doing well thank you
