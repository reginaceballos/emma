30,probably procrastinating so much in my homework it just feels like there's so much to do
6,some days it's great some days it's not we have finals coming up soon so lately it's been a little bit more difficult I guess because I have a lot of thoughts on my mind at night
5,it was maybe a couple days ago one of my friends made a comment about me and I didn't think it was very nice and I got kind of upset
4,probably last week when I was with my family
1,I'm doing okay thanks
